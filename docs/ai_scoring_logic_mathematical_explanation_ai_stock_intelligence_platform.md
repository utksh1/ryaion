# AI Scoring Logic & Math Explanation

## AI Stock Intelligence Platform

---

## 1. Purpose of AI Scoring

The AI Scoring System converts complex market data into a **single, interpretable score (0–100)** that represents the **quality of a stock opportunity** for a given time horizon.

The score is:
- Probabilistic (not deterministic)
- Explainable
- Comparable across stocks
- Time-horizon aware

This score powers:
- AI Suggestions Dashboard
- Stocks Arena winner selection
- Risk classification
- Confidence estimation

---

## 2. High-Level Concept

Each stock is evaluated across multiple dimensions:

1. Technical Strength
2. Momentum
3. Volatility & Risk
4. Volume Confirmation
5. Sentiment Impact
6. Historical Reliability

Each dimension produces a **normalized sub-score (0–1)**.
The final AI score is a **weighted sum** of these sub-scores.

## 3. Feature Groups & Sub-Scores

---

## 3.1 Technical Strength Score (TSS)

Based on classical technical indicators.

**Indicators Used:**
- RSI
- MACD
- EMA vs SMA crossover

**Normalization:**

- RSI optimal range: 40–60
- MACD positive crossover → higher score
- EMA > SMA → bullish signal

```
TSS = (RSI_score + MACD_score + EMA_SMA_score) / 3
```

Range: 0–1

---

## 3.2 Momentum Score (MS)

Measures price acceleration.

**Inputs:**
- % price change (short-term)
- Trend slope

```
MS = normalized(price_change × trend_slope)
```

Range: 0–1

---

## 3.3 Volatility & Risk Score (VRS)

Lower volatility = higher score (risk-adjusted).

**Inputs:**
- Standard deviation of returns
- ATR (Average True Range)

```
VRS = 1 − normalized(volatility)
```

Range: 0–1

---

## 3.4 Volume Confirmation Score (VCS)

Ensures price moves are supported by volume.

**Inputs:**
- Volume spike ratio
- Average volume comparison

```
VCS = normalized(current_volume / average_volume)
```

Range: 0–1

---

## 3.5 Sentiment Score (SS)

Derived from news sentiment analysis.

**Inputs:**
- Sentiment polarity
- Impact score

```
SS = sentiment_polarity × impact_score
```

Mapped to range 0–1

---

## 3.6 Historical Reliability Score (HRS)

Measures how well similar setups worked historically.

**Inputs:**
- Backtested win rate
- Setup consistency

```
HRS = normalized(historical_win_rate)
```

Range: 0–1

---

## 4. Weight Assignment

Weights depend on **time horizon**.

### Example: Swing Trading

| Feature | Weight |
|------|------|
| Technical Strength | 0.25 |
| Momentum | 0.20 |
| Volatility & Risk | 0.20 |
| Volume Confirmation | 0.15 |
| Sentiment | 0.10 |
| Historical Reliability | 0.10 |

Weights sum to 1.0

---

## 5. Final AI Score Formula

```
AI_Score = 100 × (
  w1·TSS +
  w2·MS +
  w3·VRS +
  w4·VCS +
  w5·SS +
  w6·HRS
)
```

Range: **0–100**

---

## 6. Risk Level Classification

| AI Score | Risk Level |
|--------|-----------|
| 80–100 | Low Risk / High Quality |
| 60–79 | Medium Risk |
| 40–59 | High Risk |
| < 40 | Avoid |

---

## 7. Confidence Percentage Calculation

Confidence represents **model certainty**, not success guarantee.

**Factors:**
- Indicator alignment
- Low volatility
- High historical reliability

```
Confidence = average(
  indicator_agreement,
  1 − volatility,
  historical_win_rate
) × 100
```

---

## 8. Expected Move Estimation

Estimated using regression or probabilistic models.

```
Expected_Move = predicted_return ± error_margin
```

Time-horizon specific.

---

## 9. Stocks Arena Winner Logic

For Stock A and Stock B:

```
Winner = max(AI_Score_A, AI_Score_B)
```

Explanation generated by highlighting largest score differences.

---

## 10. Explainable AI Output

The LLM converts numeric reasoning into natural language:

Example:
> "The stock scores high due to strong momentum, low volatility, and positive sentiment, supported by historical success in similar setups."

---

## 11. Model Validation & Ethics

- Backtesting across market conditions
- Confidence tracking
- No absolute predictions
- Explicit disclaimer shown to users

---

## 12. Academic Justification

- Multi-factor quantitative model
- Risk-adjusted scoring
- Interpretable weighted system
- Suitable for finance + AI coursework
